# What is true happiness?

Why do people keep searching for it, keep moving forward, keep looking ahead, and keep getting carried away by the winds of life?

Have you ever heard of the basic humand needs in life? It may be similar to the Maslow model as shown below.

Yahh, it is what you see, and you can test it yourself. Does it exist in a sustainable way? And how can they be sustained in the long run?

It's all thanks to the **human wisdom**.

# What is human wisdom?

Based on one of the famous quotes of Zen master **[Thich Nhat Hanh](https://tuoitre.vn/thien-su-thich-nhat-hanh-bieu-tuong-cua-doi-thoai-va-hoa-giai-20220123074751265.htm)** on as reported in [TuoiTre newspaper](https://tuoitre.vn/).

> *Cội nguồn của tình yêu nằm sâu trong mỗi chúng ta. Chúng ta có thể giúp người khác hạnh phúc. Một lời nói, một hành động, một suy nghĩ cũng có thể làm vơi nỗi buồn và tăng hạnh phúc cho người khác.*

It means: "*The root of love lies deep within each of us. We can help others be happy. A word, an action, a thought can also alleviate sadness and increase happiness for others.*"

The life is not easy, but let is try to live in a kind anyway, learning from the example of Great Uncle Ho. The great achievements that we reap will bring lasting happinies
